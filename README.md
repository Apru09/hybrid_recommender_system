# hybrid_recommender_system

This project is a hybrid recommender which incorporates content based and collaborative based filtering to generate recommendations.
This model tries to address cold start problem in recommender systems. As the model struggles to make recommendations to the user
when data is insufficient (no ratings), content based filtering is used until the model collects enough data to establish a good 
collaborative filtering.
